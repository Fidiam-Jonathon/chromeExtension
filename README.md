# chromeExtension
This is a work in progress, my goal is to help improve the experience of those who are visually imparied use mobile devices with web browsers
particularly Chrome.  I plan to implement the following features:
Must have requirements
-	Change and save font size globally, allowing the user to increase or decrease the font size.
-	Change and save background color, using a sophisticated color picker, globally
-	Change and save font color in order to allow users to maximize readability
-	Performance impact must be kept to an absolute minimum
Stretch goals
-	Port extension to other popular browsers such as IE, Safari and Opera
-	Add extra accessibility options, possibly using libraries such as React or Redux.  Not sure what these features are now, will have to brainstorm.
-	Provide presets for different types of color-blindness.
